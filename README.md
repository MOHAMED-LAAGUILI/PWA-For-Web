# PWA-For-Web
Progressive web application
- its only works for localhost and hosting with https protocol
- http not supported so it wont work

A progressive web app (PWA) is a website that looks and behaves as if it is a mobile app. PWAs are built to take advantage of native mobile device features, without requiring the end user to visit an app store, make a purchase and download software locally. Instead, a PWA can be located with a search engine query and accessed immediately through a browser.
